## 📝 Analysis:
All the words above are the names of athletics, and their frequencies are correlated with public event.

Phelps was mentioned most in 2009 as he was suspended for three months after photos emerged that appeared to show him smoking marijuana. 

Usain appeared in the second frequency ranking in 2008 and became the most frequent word in 2015. An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Usain is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, and 2016). In 2009, he became famous with the title of the fastest man alive. His career achievements correlate with the graph as 2008 marks the first increase in frequency and 2012 marks a significant increase.
